# odin-recipes
This project is to produce a basic recipe website with multiple pages using HTML. 
It demonstrates my ability to use HTML through the inclusion of:
Paragraphs
Headings
Ordered Lists
Unordered Lists
Images 
Links
Working on this project also allowed me to practice GIT commands using the command line.
