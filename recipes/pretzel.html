    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pretzels are not the easiest thing to make, so I asked a baker friend of mine for tips.
    <br>This recipe is simple enough that even I made it successfully, you won't even need a mixer.
    <br>You will need to set aside 2 1/2 hours, and be prepared to knead for 8-12 minutes! Makes 8 pretzels.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>340 mls water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>7g active dry yeast</li>
    <li>4 1/2 cups of plain flour</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons of oil</li>
    <li>2/3 cup baking soda</li>
    <li>2 eggs, beaten for egg wash</li>
    <li>coarse salt for presentation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
 <li>In a bowl mix water, salt and sugar until combined. Add yeast and let mixture rest 5 minutes until yeast starts to form</li>   
<li>Add flour and two tablespoons of oil, mix thoroughly until dough forms</li>
<li>Remove dough and use the remaining oil to coat the inside of the bowl</li>
<li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap, and leave in warm place for 1 hour e.g. you could leave it in a larger bowl filled with warm water</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 230C</li>
<li>Cut dough into 8 pieces, roll into balls and let rest for 10 minutes</li>
<li>Roll pieces into ropes, and then shape them into pretzels</li>
<li>Add baking soda to a large pot of water, bring to rolling boil. Boil each pretzel for 30 seconds per side</li>
<li>Transfer pretzels to a baking sheet, brush with egg wash, and sprinkle with salt</li>
<li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown</li>
</ol>
